## Instructions to run:

-> Dependencies: (1) numpy >= '1.21.5' 	(2) cv2 >= 3.0.0
-> open file djikstra_abhimanyu_saxena.py in the folder
-> run file and enter start and goal coordinates
-> sample input 1 : start(10,40); goal = (560,40) -- Results in folder "test case 1"
-> sample input 2 : start(5,5); goal = (200,200)  -- Results in folder "test case 2"
-> code generates required files 'djikstra_viz.avi' to animate node exploration and "Path_Taken.jpg" to show optimal path taken
-> prints time taken by algorithm in minutes


# Note: The aniation is sped up 16x to get a reasonable speed of visualisation, Additionally, GIF is also provided which runs for about 10 sec
# Known Issues: The bloating of objects is a little uneven around slant surfaces, like hexagon and triangle
